## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I used this challenge as an opportunity to continue practicing css and accessibility. It was more challenging than I expected. For accessibility, I did my best, but I have questions about best-practices:
- should I have added an aria-label to the image link to view the product? If I do that, the screenreader ignores the image alt text. I don't know which is less confusing.
- I added a hidden h1 to the page as there wasn't one. I couldn't find a definitive answer whether this was a good thing to do or not.  

Other questions:
- I also want to know if there's a better way to get the time limit text to the right side other than adding a left margin to it.

### Continued development

Continue practicing CSS and making my pages more accessible.
